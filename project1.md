Solution stacks are sets of individual components that create a complete environment for application development. The components are usually independently developed, but their frequent combined usage and compatibility qualify them to become a stack.

The LAMP stack is a popular open-source solution stack used primarily in web development (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
