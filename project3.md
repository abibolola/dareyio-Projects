# SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

In this project, to implement a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

MERN Web stack consists of following components:

- MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
- ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
- ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

```curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -```

- Install Node.js with the command below ```sudo apt-get install -y nodejs```

- Create a new directory for your To-Do project and enter the dir: ``` mkdir Todo && cd Todo```

- Use the command ```npm init``` to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created.
